# Online Learning Applications - Pricing Project - Team 24

The following repository contains the notebook for the pricing project performed as part of the course Online Learning Applications Spring 2022. 

The relevant thirdparty libs used can be found installed from the `requirements.txt` in order to run the notebook. Two modalities of the environment can be run; one with a fully connected graph of products, and one with a sparsely connected graph. By default it is set to the fully connected graph, and to change it comment out the fully connected graph and uncomment the sparse graph in the first code block under the _Initialize parameters_ part of the notebook. The resulting plots of the performance of the sparse graph may also be found in the subfolder `\sparse_plots`.
